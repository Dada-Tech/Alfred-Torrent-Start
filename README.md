# Alfred-Torrent-Workflow
Primarily to start all torrent files in specified (or defult) torrent app like uTorrent, etc. Also Streamlines opening deleting multiple files associated with torrent files (.torrent,.download,.dmg,.zip)

Methods to streamline mundane tasks involved in handing multiple torrenting files within the Downloads folder:
includes methods to open (and delete) .torrent, .zip, .dmg files
includes method to open and clear files of any exension (at your own risk)

1.0, first rudimentary release, proof of concept.



- tested OSX 10.12.4


Important Concerns:
Will resolve same file name of .torrent.download files already existing in trash by permanently deleting (with rm) the file in download

Will resolve same file name of all other files already existing in trash by overiting the file in trash with the file in downloads folder


--Extra--
I'd appreciate any help/contributions/pointers on how to improve because its my first time publishing anything on GitHub
Also on the Alfred Workflow itself as I am new to that as well.

Enjoy!
