# Alfred-Torrent-Workflow
Starts or deletes all files of type .torrent or .torrent.download

can start with default app that handles .torrent files or specify which app you want to open it with (at your own risk) then
prints which app (default or otherwise) that the files were opened with.




--Extra--
I'd appreciate any help/contributions/pointers on how to improve because its my first time publishing anything on GitHub
Also on the Alfred Workflow itself as I am new to that as well.

Enjoy!
